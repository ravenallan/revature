##### Annotations

- Begin with `@` symbol, no semicolon`;`
- Provides info to compiler and 3rd party tools about how their subjects should be treated

One of the few pre-defined annotations is `@Override` which indicates to the compiler that the annotated method should override a method inherited from a superclass.
